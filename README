Repository containing the BPM firmware

===============================================

The project is based on tools and projects developed by CERN and others:

hdl-make:
	http://www.ohwr.org/projects/hdl-make
wishbone-gen:
	http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wishbone-gen
platform-independent core collection: 
	http://www.ohwr.org/projects/general-cores
white-rabbit core collection:
	http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-cores

===============================================

This repository makes use of git submodules, located at 'cores' folder:
	cores/general-cores
	cores/hdl-make
	cores/wishbone-gen
	cores/wr-cores

And custom modules (based or not on others):
	cores/hdl-make2

	Also, there is a modification to the hdlmake program, called
	hdlmake2, in order to support the ISim simulation software.

To clone the whole repository use the following command:

	$ git clone --recursive git://github.com/lerwys/BPM_project.git
	or
	$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:lerwys/BPM_project.git

For older versions of Git (<1.6.5), use the following:

	$ git clone git://github.com/lerwys/BPM_project.git
	or
	$ git clone git@github.com:lerwys/BPM_project.git

	$ git submodule init
	$ git submodule update

===============================================

Known Issues:

	If you plan on using the hdlmake2 (modified from the original 
	hdlmake) with Xilinx simulation tool (ISim), there is a know
	bug. 

	The ISim tool may issue an error when trying to return a value
	with structured access. See example below (extracted from
	Xilinx Foruns: http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Simulation-and
	-Verification/FATAL-ERROR-in-ISIM-Simulator-when-
	derefencing-pointer-to-array/td-p/189894:

	function toString(vector: std_ulogic_vector) return string is
	begin
		return toLine(vector).all;
	end toString;

	The above snippet won't compile. The workaround to this
	bug is breaking the return line into two.

	function toString(vector:std_ulogic_vector) return string is
		variable templ : line;
	begin
		templ := toLine(vector);
		return templ.all;
	end toString;
